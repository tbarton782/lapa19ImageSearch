1.  Play with compression size
2.  How to append pickle file (ex: add new rocks)
3.  How to read pickle file
4.  While the algorithm works well handling scale and rotation (z-axis), it seems to
struggle when the rock is rotated around the x or y-axis.  We may need to
encourage users to take pictures at 90 degrees to the rock surface.
5.  The algorithm also seems sensitive to shaking (blurry images)
6.  Try circle cropping
7.  General SIFT tuning
