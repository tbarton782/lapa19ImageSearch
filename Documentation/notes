4.  While the algorithm works well handling scale and rotation (z-axis), it seems to
struggle when the rock is rotated around the x or y-axis.  We may need to
encourage users to take pictures at 90 degrees to the rock surface.
5.  The algorithm also seems sensitive to camera shaking (blurry images) and
glossy coatings.  "Hold camera steady, and orientate the rock to avoid glares."
6.  Try circle cropping
